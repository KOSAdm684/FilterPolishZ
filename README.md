# Introduction 
FilterPolishZ is a tool that simplifies the development and management of .filter (Path of Exile filters) files. It has been specifically designed as a personal automation assistant and has a very niche usecase. The codebase however (with some deveopment knowledge) can be adjusted fairly easily to generate other filters.

# Features

1.	Parses .filter files and creates an internal representation
2.  Rebuilds and improves the readability of .filter files.
3.	Performs automatic table of content adjustments
4.	Performs automatic cleaning of .filter files
5.  Works with filter-tags to create sub-strictnesses and sub-styles of the filter.
6.  Uses the poe.ninja API to gather economy data
7.  Performs eoconomy-based auto-tiering for uniques, divination cards, fossils, shaper/elder basetypes.
8.  Improves the auto-tiering by enriching and data-mining information
9.  Provides a comfortable UI to do tiering, tag-modification and other operations
10. Assists in CI/CD operations
11. Annotates economy data with "aspects" to increase tiering accuracy.
